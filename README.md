## Saloon Seat Reservation System

The basic aim for implementing Saloon management system is to eliminate the waiting time for the customers at saloon for waiting for their turn for the service. This system would allow customers to view different saloons listed on the application, and view their services offered; also reserve seats for a specific service at any date and time according to their convenience and also pay in advance for the service they which they opted for. The shopkeepers also get an interface to update the seats reservations and their services, also auto-generate invoice for the customers.

Customers can create thier profile and log into the application. They can view all the saloons listed on the system and the services they provide. Customers can book slot according to thier convinience. Customers would recieve an automated booking confermation email after boking.

**Customer Section** - Customers can create thier profile and log into the application. They can view all the saloons listed on the system and the services they provide. Customers can book slot according to thier convinience. Customers would recieve an automated booking confermation email after boking.

**Seller Section** - Saloon Owners (shopkeepers) can view all bookings. Edit Saloon and Saloon Services details and manage bookings.
